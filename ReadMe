Implementation of Image Based Classifier and $1 Recognizer
Classify the objects and weights in Free Body Diagram Mechanical System
The classifier will work only if at least one of both objects and numbers is drawn in the GUI. 
The code is written in such a way that it will work only when both numbers and objects are drawn else it will give an error of undefined variables.


The output of the classifiers will provide following information:
1. The object or number you draw and in the order you draw. For example, in above output
figures, we drew the Fixed-support first, then we drew spring and successively we drew
Block, Damper, Roller-Support, 4,3,2.
2. It will provide the location of each number if it is above the object or inside the object or
below the object. In the example images provided, 4 is draw above the object, 3 is inside
the block and 2 is below the damper. Thus the output can provide this information.
3. Similarly, it will also provide the location of the objects in the order you draw them as can
be seen in the outputs above.
4. If we draw two numbers one above the other, it will misclassify as can be seen in the below
images.

Instruction to run the classifier:
Open Ink.m in MATLAB and run
Draw the mechanical system with its weights (refer report.pdf) for example
Once done, press "Save" button
Results of the classifier will be displayed on the command window
